# Introduction
I started this tasklist on the 16th of May to keep track of my progress. I'll try to update it regularly so that the git repo has a record of my evolving conception of the project.

# Aims
1. Demonstrate self organisation in natural systems
2. Use computer algorithms to demonstrate how ecological actions have repercussions that cut across scales
3. Learn the basics of computer vision
4. Learn to build stream tables
5. Create some resources that help others to learn to build stream tables

# Components

## Complete
 - A 600 x 900mm stainless steel tray
 - waterproofing for the tray
 - 9 small coloured house tokens
 - A bilge pump controlled by a relay switch
 - A Bluefruit that can control the relay switch and sense bluetooth proximity

## To Build
 - *(time estimate) Description*
 - (1) Drains from the tray
 - (2) Choose a power source
 - (3) A filter to keep stream medium from clogging the drain
 - (10) Test and choose a medium
 - (4) Test and set the slope of the tray
 - (4) A hose attachment to bring water from the resevoir at the bottom to the top of the stream
 - (8) Code a microcontroller to receive a bluetooth signal and control the speed of a motor
 - (2.5) Test the speed of the motor necessary to deliver a range of flows with minimal lag
 - (6) Hang a Raspberry Pi from the ceiling
 - (6) Code Bluetooth transmission from the RPi to the microcontroller
 - (14) Code image recognition in the RPi

Total of 58.5 hours estimated

# Task List

## Past (what was done when)

### 14th of May 
- Flashed an OS to an SD card for the RPi

### 15th of May
- Plugged in RPi for first time
- Plugged in RPi camera
- Tested RPi camera from the command line
- Reflashed the RPi OS (because I forgot what password I'd chosen)

- Used liquid nails to patch holes in the bottom of the stainless tray
- Used liquid nails to attach platic washers to the drains of the stainless tray
- Used silastic to seal all holes in the stainless tray

## Future (what I'm aiming to do when)
