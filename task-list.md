# Introduction
I started this tasklist on the 16th of May to keep track of my progress. I'll try to update it regularly so that the git repo has a record of my evolving conception of the project.

# Aims
1. Demonstrate self organisation in natural systems
2. Use computer algorithms to demonstrate how ecological actions have repercussions that cut across scales
3. Learn the basics of computer vision
4. Learn to build stream tables
5. Create some resources that help others to learn to build stream tables

# Components

## Complete
 - A 600 x 900mm stainless steel tray
 - waterproofing for the tray
 - 9 small coloured house tokens
 - A bilge pump controlled by a relay switch
 - A Bluefruit that can control the relay switch and sense bluetooth proximity
 - A filter to keep stream medium from clogging the drain

## To Build
 - *(time estimate) Description*
 - (1) Drains from the tray
 - (2) Choose a power source
 - (10) Test and choose a medium
 - (4) Test and set the slope of the tray
 - (4) A hose attachment to bring water from the resevoir at the bottom to the top of the stream
 - (8) Code a microcontroller to receive a bluetooth signal and control the speed of a motor
 - (2.5) Test the speed of the motor necessary to deliver a range of flows with minimal lag
 - (6) Hang a Raspberry Pi from the ceiling
 - (6) Code Bluetooth transmission from the RPi to the microcontroller
 - (14) Code image recognition in the RPi

Total of 55.5 hours estimated

# Task List

## Past (what was done when)

### 6th of May
 - Drilled drain holes in the bed of the stainless tray (Thanks for the help Dave!)

### 11th of May
 - Disassembled axolotl
 - Organised build box
 - Made plastic washers for the drains using the hole saw attachment for the drill
 - Cut the cross-brace out of the stainless tray using the angle grinder
 - Tidied up all sharp burs with the angle grinder

### 14th of May 
- Flashed an OS to an SD card for the RPi

### 15th of May
- Plugged in RPi for first time
- Plugged in RPi camera
- Tested RPi camera from the command line (Thanks for the tips Ant!)
- Reflashed the RPi OS (because I forgot what password I chose yesterday)

- Used liquid nails to patch holes in the bottom of the stainless tray
- Used liquid nails to attach platic washers to the drains of the stainless tray
- Used silastic to seal all holes in the stainless tray

### 16th of May
- Wrote this plan

Worked for about 2.5 hours in the lab
- Did a flood test of the waterproofing and it was a success
- built a filter for the drain
- Tested LDPE as a medium - it was a failure because it just floats
- Rebooted the RPi.

## Future (what I'm aiming to do when)

### 17th of May
- Meet with Ben Fox to talk about demo day
-
